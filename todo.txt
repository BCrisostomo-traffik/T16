It looks amazing on my iPhone, guys. Two small issues:
 
• There is some crowding of the logos at the bottom. Traffik and SGSCO company is one unit. The sgsco logo is another unit. I’d love a bit more space between them if we can.
 
• Also, on the our work page, type is a bit wonky / all over the place. And I think we’re getting the wrong fonts in a few places too. Let’s just geo on font, same size throughout?
